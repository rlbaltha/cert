        <p>The Sustainability Certificate is a 17-hour certificate that requires students to take a three-hour anchor course,
            one three-hour course under each pillar of sustainability, two one-hour seminars, as well as complete a four-hour capstone course.</p>

        <p>Through the process of obtaining the sustainability certificate, students gain knowledge about the myriad of issues pertaining to sustainability,
            achieve enlightened perspectives about what sustainability means for individuals, communities, and the world, and acquire experience applying
            this understanding to meaningful, real-world situations. The sustainability certificate equips students with the skills to make significant,
            systemic changes in their communities, paving the way for a more sustainable future. </p>
